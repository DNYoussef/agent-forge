## Current Blockers and Mitigations

### Technical Blockers
1. **Unicode encoding issues** in security scripts
   - Mitigation: Manual execution with encoding fixes

2. **NASA POT10 analyzer import issues**
   - Mitigation: Rebuild analyzer with proper dependencies

3. **Security gate configuration**
   - Mitigation: Step-by-step gate deployment

### Resource Allocation
- **Full Princess domain commitment** to security sprint
- **Daily security standups** for coordination
- **Escalation procedures** for blocking issues
- **Executive oversight** for critical decisions

## Production Deployment Dependencies

### Security Clearance Requirements
- Zero critical vulnerabilities
- <10 medium vulnerabilities
- 92% NASA POT10 compliance
- All security gates operational
- Security monitoring active

### Deployment Approval Chain
1. Security Princess certification
2. Quality Princess validation
3. Coordination Princess approval
4. Infrastructure Princess deployment readiness
5. Executive stakeholder sign-off

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- 4-week timeline for comprehensive security remediation
- 92% compliance improvement requirement
- Complex vulnerability landscape

### Risk Mitigations
- Parallel work across all Princess domains
- Automated security testing integration
- Weekly milestone validation
- Emergency rollback procedures

### Contingency Plans
- Extended security sprint (additional 1-2 weeks)
- Phased production deployment
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting
- Rapid response security team

## Current Status: SECURITY SPRINT ACTIVE

**Next Milestone**: Week 1 Critical Vulnerability Elimination
**Security Lead**: Security Princess with full Princess domain support
**Target**: Production security clearance by Week 4
**Confidence**: HIGH (comprehensive plan and resources allocated)

The security remediation is now underway with full Princess domain coordination and automated tools deployment. All necessary frameworks are in place to achieve production security clearance within the 4-week timeline.
