# Agent Forge Phase Audit Framework

## Audit Criteria for Each Phase

### 1. PRODUCTION THEATER CHECK
- **Threshold**: <60% theater score (FAIL if above)
- **Method**: Code analysis for mock/fake implementations
- **Evidence**: Actual vs claimed functionality ratio

### 2. FUNCTIONALITY CHECK
- **Threshold**: >80% core requirements met
- **Method**: Feature verification against specifications
- **Evidence**: Working demonstrations and test results

### 3. SAFETY CHECK
- **Threshold**: Zero critical/high security issues
- **Method**: Bandit scanner + NASA POT10 compliance
- **Evidence**: Security scan reports

### 4. INTEGRATION CHECK
- **Threshold**: 100% cross-component compatibility
- **Method**: Phase-to-phase data flow testing
- **Evidence**: Integration test results

### 5. LOCATION CHECK
- **Threshold**: 100% files in C:\Users\17175\Desktop\agent-forge
- **Method**: Path validation for all operations
- **Evidence**: File location audit trail

- **Location**: PASS - All in agent-forge directory

## Phase 1 Overall Status: PASS WITH WARNINGS

### Achievements:
- ✅ All emergency fixes completed
- ✅ Zero theater in fixes applied
- ✅ All work in correct directory
- ✅ Full functionality restored

### Warnings:
- ⚠️ Phase 3 has 73% theater (CRITICAL)
- ⚠️ Performance issues across platform
- ⚠️ Phases 7-8 incomplete

## Phase 2 Core Implementation Plan

### Development Princess Tasks
1. Create src/evomerge/core/EvolutionaryEngine.py
2. Implement SLERP, TIES, DARE operators
3. Complete agent registry backend
4. Replace Phase 3 theater implementations

### Security Princess Tasks
1. Fix remaining 421 medium/low issues
2. Implement NASA POT10 measurements
3. Add security gates to CI/CD
4. Theater detection automation

### Quality Princess Tasks
1. Eliminate 73% theater in Phase 3
2. Expand Playwright test coverage
3. Performance optimization (<3s load)
4. Integration test suite

### Research Princess Tasks
1. Document reality gaps found
2. Research missing algorithms
3. Update architecture docs
4. Validate requirements

## Audit Schedule

| Phase | Timeline | Lead Princess | Audit Focus |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Complete | Quality | Emergency stabilization |
| Phase 2 | Week 2-3 | Development | Core implementation |
| Phase 3 | Week 4-5 | Coordination | Integration |
| Phase 4 | Week 6-7 | Security | Production readiness |
| Final | Week 8 | Quality | Certification |

## Audit Automation Commands

```bash
# Theater Detection
python scripts/theater-detector.py --threshold 60

# Functionality Verification
python scripts/functionality-audit.py --requirements specs/

# Safety Scan
bandit -r . -f json -o safety-report.json

# Integration Testing
pytest tests/integration/ --json-report

# Location Validation
python scripts/location-validator.py --root "C:\Users\17175\Desktop\agent-forge"
```

## Critical Quality Gates

1. **NO DEPLOYMENT** if theater score >60%
2. **NO DEPLOYMENT** if security issues critical/high
3. **NO DEPLOYMENT** if integration tests fail
4. **NO DEPLOYMENT** if files outside agent-forge
5. **NO DEPLOYMENT** if functionality <80%

## Princess Domain Accountability

Each Princess is responsible for:
1. Maintaining theater score <10% in their domain
2. Ensuring 100% functionality of assigned components
3. Zero critical safety issues in their files
4. Full integration with other domains
5. All work in agent-forge directory only

## Continuous Monitoring

- Real-time theater detection alerts
- Hourly functionality checks
- Daily safety scans
- Integration tests on every commit
- Path validation on all file operations
