**Current Gate Status:** ‚ùå BLOCKING (0.0% < 92% threshold)

**Demonstration of Gate Blocking:**
```bash
$ python scripts/nasa_compliance_report.py
NASA POT10 Compliance Report Generator
==================================================
COMPLIANCE SUMMARY
==================
Overall Score: 0.0%
Compliance Level: CRITICAL
Gate Status: FAIL
Total Files: 381
Total Violations: 3219

IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
  - URGENT: Address all high-severity violations immediately
  - Focus on Rules 4 (function length) and 7 (return checking)
  - Implement code review process before any deployments
```

**Gate Successfully Blocks Non-Compliant Code:** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
