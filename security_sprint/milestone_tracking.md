## Progress Tracking Dashboard Metrics

### Real-Time Tracking Indicators
- **🟢 Green**: On track or ahead of schedule
- **🟡 Yellow**: At risk but manageable
- **🔴 Red**: Behind schedule or blocked
- **✅ Complete**: Milestone achieved
- **❌ Failed**: Milestone not met

### Daily Progress Updates
Each Princess domain updates their progress daily by 17:00 using the format:
- **Completed Today**: [list of accomplishments]
- **Planned Tomorrow**: [list of planned activities]
- **Blockers**: [any impediments]
- **Help Needed**: [assistance required]

### Weekly Sprint Health Score
Calculated weekly based on:
- Milestone completion rate (40%)
- Quality gate pass rate (30%)
- Risk mitigation effectiveness (20%)
- Cross-domain coordination quality (10%)

Target: >85% health score each week

This milestone tracking system ensures comprehensive visibility into sprint progress and enables proactive management of risks and blockers across all Princess domains.
