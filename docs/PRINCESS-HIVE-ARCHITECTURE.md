- Theater elimination
- Security resolution
- Documentation alignment

**Weeks 5-8**: Integration & Testing
- End-to-end system integration
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing
- Final documentation

## Context DNA Storage

### Memory MCP Integration

```json
{
  "project_fingerprint": {
    "entity_type": "PROJECT_CONTEXT",
    "observations": [
      "Working directory: C:\\Users\\17175\\Desktop\\agent-forge",
      "Project boundary: .project-boundary marker verified",
      "Architecture: 8-phase AI agent creation pipeline",
      "Current status: Emergency stabilization phase"
    ]
  },
  "princess_contexts": {

## 9-Step Dev Swarm Integration

1. **Initialize Swarm**: Coordination Princess leads
2. **Agent Discovery**: Domain-specific agent assignment
3. **MECE Task Division**: No overlap, complete coverage
4. **Parallel Deployment**: All Princesses simultaneously
5. **Theater Detection**: Quality Princess validates
6. **Sandbox Integration**: Infrastructure Princess deploys
7. **Documentation Updates**: Research Princess syncs
8. **Test Validation**: Quality Princess verifies
9. **Cleanup & Completion**: Coordination Princess handoff

## 3-Loop System Integration

### Loop 1: Planning (Research Princess Lead)
- spec->research->premortem->plan
- Output: Risk-mitigated foundation

### Loop 2: Development (Development Princess Lead)
- swarm->MECE->deploy->theater
- Output: Theater-free implementation

### Loop 3: Quality (Quality Princess Lead)
- analysis->root_cause->fixes->validation
- Output: 100% test success

## Quality Gates & Thresholds

- **NASA Compliance**: >=92%
- **Theater Score**: <60
- **Test Coverage**: >=80%
- **Security Score**: >=95%
- **MECE Validation**: 100% (no overlaps)

## Agent Prompt Protocol

All agents MUST follow:

```python
WORKING_DIR=C:\\Users\\17175\\Desktop\\agent-forge
1. TodoWrite FIRST: "Working in: {absolute_path}"
2. Verify .project-boundary marker
3. Use ABSOLUTE PATHS ONLY
4. Batch all operations in single message
5. Store findings in memory MCP
6. Regular progress updates
```

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Initialize coordination framework
python scripts/princess-coordination-framework.py

# Deploy emergency stabilization
./scripts/deploy-emergency-stabilization.sh

# Check status
cat emergency-status.json

# View coordination manifest
cat princess-coordination-manifest.json
```

## Success Metrics

- Emergency stabilization complete: Week 1
- Core functionality restored: Week 2
- Theater eliminated: Week 4
- Full integration: Week 8
- NASA POT10 compliance: >=92%
- Zero merge conflicts
- All tests passing
