### Phase 1: Critical Violations (Weeks 1-4)
**Target:** Reduce violations by 80%, achieve 40% compliance

#### Priority 1: Rule 7 - Return Value Checking (3,004 violations)
**Impact:** Highest violation count, critical for error handling

**Actions:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Implement automated detection and fixing
   ```python
   # Before (violation)
   os.getcwd()
   database.execute(query)

   # After (compliant)
   current_dir = os.getcwd()
   result = database.execute(query)
   if not result:
       handle_error()
   ```

2. **Week 3-4:** Manual review of critical functions
   - Focus on security-related modules first
   - Database operations
   - File I/O operations
   - Network calls

**Tools:**
- Use AST-based auto-fixer for simple cases
- Code review checklist for manual fixes
- IDE plugins for real-time detection

#### Priority 2: Rule 4 - Function Length (186 violations)
**Impact:** Maintainability and testability

**Actions:**
1. **Week 2-3:** Break down longest functions first
   - Target functions >100 lines immediately
   - Extract utility functions
   - Use Extract Method refactoring

2. **Week 4:** Establish function length monitoring
   - Pre-commit hook enforcement
   - IDE warnings at 50+ lines

**Example Refactoring:**
```python
# Before: 74-line function
def _setup_event_handlers(self):
    # 74 lines of mixed responsibilities

# After: Multiple focused functions
def _setup_websocket_handlers(self):
    # 25 lines - websocket specific

def _setup_progress_handlers(self):
    # 20 lines - progress specific

def _setup_error_handlers(self):
    # 15 lines - error handling
```

#### Priority 3: Rule 10 - Compilation Warnings (29 violations)
**Impact:** Code quality and maintainability

**Actions:**
1. **Week 1:** Fix bare except clauses
   ```python
   # Before
   except:
       pass

   # After
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
   ```

2. **Week 1:** Update string formatting
3. **Week 2:** Enable strict linting in CI/CD

### Phase 2: Structural Improvements (Weeks 5-8)
**Target:** Achieve 70% compliance

#### Rule 1: Control Flow Complexity
**Actions:**
- Simplify nested exception handling
- Reduce deep conditional nesting
- Extract complex logic to separate functions

#### Rule 2: Loop Bounds
**Actions:**
- Add explicit bounds to all while loops
- Replace `while True` with bounded alternatives
- Add timeout mechanisms for long-running loops

#### Rule 5: Assertion Density
**Actions:**
- Add precondition assertions (2% of lines minimum)
- Implement postcondition checks
- Add invariant assertions in loops

### Phase 3: Advanced Compliance (Weeks 9-12)
**Target:** Achieve 92% compliance

#### Rule 3: Dynamic Allocation
**Actions:**
- Pre-allocate data structures in `__init__`
- Replace list comprehensions with pre-allocated lists
- Use fixed-size collections where possible

#### Rule 6: Variable Scope
**Actions:**
- Move module-level variables to class scope
- Eliminate global variables
- Use constants for module-level values

#### Rule 8: Import Usage
**Actions:**
- Eliminate dynamic imports (`__import__`, `exec`)
- Simplify relative imports
- Use static imports only

#### Rule 9: Attribute Dereferencing
**Actions:**
- Limit attribute chains to 2 levels
- Store intermediate values in local variables
- Avoid deep object navigation

### Implementation Tools and Integration

#### 1. Pre-commit Hook Installation
```bash
# Install NASA POT10 pre-commit hook
cd /path/to/agent-forge
python -m src.security.compliance_gate install-hook

# Hook will automatically:
# - Analyze staged Python files
# - Block commits below compliance threshold
# - Show violation details and fixes
```

#### 2. CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/nasa-compliance.yml
name: NASA POT10 Compliance
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run NASA POT10 Compliance Check
        run: |
          python scripts/nasa_compliance_report.py
          # Exit code 1 if compliance < 92%
```

#### 3. IDE Integration
**VS Code Settings:**
```json
{
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintArgs": [
    "--load-plugins=nasa_pot10_checker"
  ]
}
```

#### 4. Automated Fixes
```bash
# Run automated fixes for simple violations
python -m src.security.compliance_gate auto-fix src/

# Generates:
# - Fixed code files
# - Backup of original files
# - Fix report with success/failure rates
```
